				<p>
					I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering major at UCLA and I am interested in software engineering, data science, IoT, and creating personal side projects!
					I am always open to learn new things and explore different fields within CS out there. The languages I am most familiar with are C,C++, and Python. I worked with
				Java when creating an Android app for my internship project at Viasat, even though I've never had experience programming in Java. But with some perseverance and a little self
				learning, I was able to pull through and create my first Android app! To learn more about my experiences and projects, feel free to explore my projects or read my resume.
